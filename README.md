# Feedback Hub for Copilot Extensions

Welcome to the Copilot Extensions Feedback Hub. This public repository is designed to facilitate feedback exchange between users and publishers of GitHub Copilot Extensions. It serves as the primary channel for feedback directly to publishers during the Copilot Extensions public beta.

### Important: Feedback for the GitHub Product Team
If your feedback pertains to GitHub Copilot Extensions in general (e.g., tooling, bugs, feature requests) or the GitHub Marketplace (specifically around publishing, verifying your organization, or managing your listing), please submit it to our [Community Discussions](#) forum. This repository is _only_ for feedback intended for publishers of individual Copilot Extensions.

## For Users: Submitting Feedback

If you’re using a Copilot Extension and would like to provide **feedback directly to the publisher**, please follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Correct Label**:
   - Each Copilot Extension listed in the GitHub Marketplace typically has a label corresponding to its slug name (part of the URL in its listing).
   - Use the slug name as the label if your feedback is intended for the publisher of that extension.

2. **Create a GitHub Issue**: 
   - Navigate to the "Issues" tab in this repository.
   - Click on "New Issue" and describe your feedback in detail.
   - Apply the appropriate label using the extension’s slug name.

3. **Engage with Publishers or the GitHub Team**: After submitting your issue, the extension’s publisher may respond to gather more details or provide updates. Keep an eye on the issue thread for any follow-up.

4. **Stay Organized**: Ensure your feedback is directed to the specific Copilot Extension by applying the corresponding label. For status updates, you can turn on Issue notifications in the right-hand sidebar.

Your feedback is essential in helping publishers improve their Copilot Extensions during this beta phase.

## For Publishers: Monitoring & Managing Feedback

As a publisher of a Copilot Extension, this repository allows you to monitor and manage the feedback that users provide. Feedback issues are tagged with labels corresponding to your extension’s slug name. Here’s how to get started:

1. **Reviewing Feedback via Issues**:
   - Navigate to the "Issues" tab to see all feedback in a list format.
   - Use the "Filter" dropdown to select your extension’s label and view relevant feedback for your listing.

2. **Reviewing Feedback via Project Boards**:
   - Access the feedback board through the "Projects" tab in this repository.
   - Filter the board by your extension’s label to see all associated feedback in one place.
   - You can use this Project board to manage and track the status of each feedback issue. Make sure to regularly review and update the board to resolve feedback in a timely manner.

3. **Responding to Feedback**:
   - Engage with users by commenting on issues.
   - Keep the discussion constructive and focused on resolving or addressing the feedback.
   - Once feedback has been addressed, you can close the issue.
