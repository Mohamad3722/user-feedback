# Copilot Extensions Feedback Hub

Welcome to the **Copilot Extensions Feedback Hub**. This public repository is meant to facilitate feedback exchange between users and publishers of GitHub Copilot Extensions. It serves as the primary channel for feedback during the Copilot Extensions public beta.

## For Users: Submitting Feedback

If you’re using a Copilot Extension and would like to provide feedback to the publisher, follow these steps to ensure your input is directed appropriately:

1. **Identify the Correct Label**:
   - Each Copilot Extension listed in the GitHub Marketplace has a unique label corresponding to its slug name. 
   - The slug name is part of the URL of the extension's listing. For example, in the URL `https://github.com/marketplace/octocat`, the slug name is `octocat`.
   - Before submitting feedback, make sure you know the correct label (slug name) for the extension you are addressing.

3. **Create a GitHub Issue**: 
   - Navigate to the "Issues" tab in this repository.
   - Click on "New Issue" and describe your feedback in detail.
   - Apply the correct label to ensure that your feedback is routed to the appropriate publisher.

4. **Engage with Publishers**: After submitting your issue, the extension's publisher may respond to gather more details or provide updates. Keep an eye on the issue thread for any follow-up.

5. **Stay Organized**: Make sure your feedback is relevant to the specific Copilot Extension. General issues or unrelated discussions should be labeled as `General`.

Your feedback is vital in helping us improve Copilot Extensions during this beta phase. 

## For Publishers: Managing Feedback

As a publisher of a Copilot Extension, this repository allows you to monitor and manage the feedback that users provide. Feedback issues are tagged with labels corresponding to your extension’s slug name. Here’s how to get started:

1. **Reviewing Feedback via Issues**:
   - Navigate to the "Issues" tab to see all feedback in a list format.
   - Use the "Filter" dropdown to select your extension’s label and view relevant feedback for your listing.

2. **Reviewing Feedback via Project Boards**:
   - Access the feedback board through the "Projects" tab in this repository.
   - You can filter the board by your extension’s label to see all associated feedback in one place.
   - You can use GitHub Projects to manage and track the status of each feedback issue.
   - Make sure to regularly review and update the board to make sure feedback is resolved in a timely manner.

3. **Responding to Feedback**:
   - Engage with users by commenting on issues.
   - Keep the discussion constructive and focused on resolving or addressing the feedback.
   - Once feedback has been addressed, you can close the issue.

This repository will be the main channel for feedback during the public beta of Copilot Extensions. For any issues not related to a specific extension, please use the `General` label.
